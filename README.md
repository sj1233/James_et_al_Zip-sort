## Leucine zipper-based sorting system enables generation of multi-functional CAR T cells

### Abstract 
Resistance to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy develops through multiple mechanisms including antigen-loss escape and tumor-induced immune suppression. Expression of multiple CARs may overcome multi-antigen-loss escape. Similarly, expression of switch receptors that convert inhibitory immune checkpoint signals into positive costimulatory signals may enhance CAR T cell activity in the tumor microenvironment.  Engineering multiple features into one cell product, however, is limited by transgene packaging constraints of current vector systems. Here, we describe a leucine zipper-based cell sorting methodology that enables selective single-step immunomagnetic purification of cells co-transduced with two vectors, designed to potentially double the number of incorporated transgenes. This “Zip-sorting” system facilitated generation of T cells simultaneously expressing up to four CARs and co-expressing up to three switch receptors. These multi-CAR multi-Switch receptor arrays enabled T cells to eliminate antigenically heterogeneous syngeneic leukemia populations co-expressing multiple inhibitory ligands. Zip-sorted multi-CAR multi-Switch receptor T cells combine therapeutic strategies to overcome multiple mechanisms of CAR T cell resistance.
